# modules/nixos/gaming/default.nix
# Console-like Steam gaming session for nixmachine.
#
# Boots straight into gamescope → Steam Big Picture (SteamOS-style) via greetd
# autologin, on the AMD GPU (Mesa/RADV). The homelab services (media / LLM /
# stirling-pdf / sshd) are independent systemd units and keep running
# underneath — SSH works before, during, and after gaming.
#
# Exit behaviour: quitting Steam ends the gamescope session; greetd then shows a
# plain agreety text login on the monitor (console-blanks on idle). The box is
# functionally headless again — just SSH in as usual.
#
# ⚠️  Steam Big Picture's power menu Shutdown / Restart powers off the WHOLE box,
#     killing the 24/7 homelab services. To return to server mode use Big
#     Picture's plain "Exit" (quit Steam), NOT Shutdown.
